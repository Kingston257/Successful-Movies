An analysis, using Structured Query Language, to evaluate what makes for a successful movie. 

## The Dataset
The public dataset, [Movies](https://github.com/Kingston257/Successful-Movies/blob/main/Movies.csv), contains list of Movies and certain details.
These details can serve as metrics to measure success.

## The Objective
To seek insights from the data using provided metrics and determine factors that make a movie successful.

## Project Activity
- Data Exploration
[View Code](https://github.com/Kingston257/Successful-Movies/blob/main/notebook.ipynb)

## Key Insights
- A movie may be highly rated but not make profit.
- The top rated movies were mostly non-English movies, although some have few vote counts.
- On the other hand, the highest grossing movies are all English movies.
- High popularity does not also guarantee movie success.
